Hi, I’m Aryaman Agarwal.

I’m a Software Engineer passionate about building solutions from scratch and learning through the process.

I discovered my love for programming when was in secondary education, learned programming in my undergraduate days abd developed passion for startups and building projects. I began with backend development, transitioned to fullstack, and now focus primarily on backend development. Currently I'm a Software Engineer at Railofy, India's largest food delivery-in-train startup. 

This was my first oppurtunity to work as a full-time employee and I've had the privilege of working with early-stage startups and collaborating closely with my seniors and founders. This experience has shaped my approach that is more product-focused, enabling me to: 

- Consider the broader product-wide impacts of features.
- Design solutions that create net-positive outcomes for all stakeholders.
- Anticipate and plan for feature scalability and extensibility.

When I’m not coding, I'm usually watching or playing sports and also reading about Indian Politics. I'm also deeply interested in religious activities and some work towards greater India. I was also a state rank Table Tennis Player and a cricketer. You would often find me playing some sports or obsessing over something new.
